**QLoop** /'kyooâ€¢loop/ - *n* - Declarative asynchronous operation loops

  - compose asynchronous operation paths as reusable "loop" constructs
  - *test-friendly* observer-pattern module favoring declarative composition
  - built-in error propagation
  - swiftPM compatible package
  - universal module; Swift 4.2+, 5 (default)

Compose `paths` of asynchronous operation `segments`, then bind them to anchors
or wrap them up into *observable* loops. Simply decorate an entity with empty `loops`
and/or `anchors`, and implement the `onChange` and/or `onError` events.

Designed to be simple to use, test, and debug. *(Or so it's intended.)*

real-world working examples of static composition, error handling, concurrent
threads, and unit-testing.

Enjoying QLoop? You might check out its soul-mate:

a library providing declarative navigation and routing features with similar
enthusiasm. Using them together, or separately, is up to you.
